<h3>Robert Tepper (h3)</h3>
<h4>No Easy Way Out</h4>

<p>
  We're not indestructible, baby better get that straight
  I think it's unbelievable how you give into the hands of fate
  Some things are worth fighting for some feelings never die
  I'm not askin' for another chance I just wanna know why
  There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
  There's no easy way out givin' in can't be wrong
</p>

<p>
  I don't wanna pacify you I don't wanna drag you down
  But I'm feelin like a prisoner like a stranger in a no named town
  I see all the angry faces afraid that could be you and me
  Talkin about what might have been I'm thinkin about what I used to be
  There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
  Ther's no easy way out givin in can't be wrong
</p>

<p>
  Baby, baby we can shed this skin we can know how we feel inside
  Instead of goin down an endless road not knowin if we're dead or alive
  Some things are worth fightin for some feelings never die
  I'm not askin for another chance I just wanna know why
  Theres no easy way out there's no shortcut home
  There's no easy way out givin in givin in can't be wrong no
  There's no easy way out there's no shortcut home
  There's no easy no easy no easy way out (repeat and fade)
</p>

<h3>Survivor (h3)</h3>

<h4>Eye Of The Tiger (h4)</h4>

<p>
  Risin up
  back on the street
  did my time took my chances
  went the distance now I'm back on my feet
  just a man and his will to survive
  so many times
  it happens too fast
  you trade your passion for glory
  don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
  you must fight just to keep them alive
</p>

<p>
  It's the eye of the tiger
  its the cream of the fight
  risin up to the challenge of our rivals
  and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
  and he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
</p>

<p>
  Face to face
  out in the heat
  hanging tough
  stayin hungry
  the stack the odds still we take to the street
  for the kill with the skill to survive...
</p>

<p>
  It's the eye of the tiger
  its the cream of the fight
  risin up to the challenge of our rivals
  and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
  and he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
</p>

<p>
  Risin up
  straight to the top
  had the guts got the glory
  went the distance now I'm not gonna stop
  just a man and his will to survive
</p>

<p>
  It's the eye of the tiger
  its the cream of the fight
  risin up to the challenge of our rivals
  and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
  and he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
